# Cropalooza (Mod for modern MC)

**Main philosophy**: Good food needs to be made from inedible ingredients/bad food.
- All the recipes don't use meat, so you can choose between just slamming down a steak or turning raw crops into food
that is equivalent/better than steak
- Makes farming viable compared to just making a cow farm, but doesn't completely debalance the existing hunger
mechanics by trying to make something better than steak

## Added

### Farm Crops

- Strawberry

## Ideas

Coffee that gives you speed!!

strawberry crumble = vanilla cake recipe but replace milk with strawberries, makes 4 slices that are equal to steak

marshmallow + campfire = roasted marshmallow
roasted marshmallow + wheat + cocoa bean = smore
wheat + sugar = graham cracker

### Tree Crops

Mixin vanilla leaves to use a custom metadata value to indicate what fruit (if any) it should grow + what sapling
to drop if broken. Harvest from the leaf by clicking it.

(Oak) Apple, orange, pear
(Jungle) banana, coconut
