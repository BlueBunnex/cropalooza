Main philosophy: Good food needs to be made from inedible ingredients/bad food.
- All the recipes don't use meat, so you can choose between just slamming down a steak or turning raw crops into food
that is equivalent/better than steak
- Makes farming viable compared to just making a cow farm, but doesn't completely debalance the existing hunger
mechanics by trying to make something better than steak

Coffee that gives you speed!!
